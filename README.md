Since I was 16 years old, I've been a computer enthusiast and mostly self-taught programmer. Now I have a bachelor's degree in computer engineering and a master's degree in computer science. I started (in the 1998) with win32 event APIs (on Windows), and now I'm working (on Linux) as a full-stack web developer with 15+ years of experience, with more focus and passion for the open source world.

I love to discover and figure out how the technologies (and things) around me are working.

#### A little more about me...

const elbowz = {
    pronouns: "He" | "Him",
    code: ["Javascript", "Python", "C/C++", "PHP", "HTML", "CSS"],
    freeTime: ["dev", "tech", "self-hosting", "electronics", "3d printing", "DIY", "movies"],
    technologies: {
        frontEnd: {
            js: ["Vue", "React", "Meteor", "Backbone", "Angular", "jQuery"],
        },
        backEnd: {
            js: ["Node", "FastAPI", "Meteor"],
        },
        devOps: ["Arch/Ubuntu", "Apache", "Nginx", "Docker", "Grafana"],
        databases: ["MongoDB", "MariaDB", "InfluxDB", "Redis", "sqlite"],
        misc: ["ML", "Docker", "Ionic", "Kafka", "MQTT", "Netflix OSS", "Joint.js", "Firebase", "ReactiveX"]
    },
};
```

#### My GitHub Data

*note:* Top languages does not indicate my skill level. It is just a metric of which languages have been hosted by me on GitHub based on the usage across repositories. There are others which I haven't put up on GitHub.-->
