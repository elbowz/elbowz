<!--
I began my technology journey as a self-taught enthusiast, immersing myself in forums, communities, and e-zines. This ignited my passion for computing, and I proudly embraced my identity as a geek. Initially, I focused on C/C++ and Win32 event APIs for native application development. Over time, I transitioned to Linux and evolved into a full-stack web developer with over 10 years of experience, while continuing to work with low-level languages and embedded systems. My deep love for open-source fuels my curiosity, and I thrive on understanding the technologies and systems that surround me.
